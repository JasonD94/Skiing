/*  For the GitHub Section link
    These styles make the GitHub Section header appear white all the time,
    unless hovered on, in which case they turn blue. I like this style better.

    I also decided to use borders instead of underlines since the J in Jason gets cut
    off by an underline, but not by a border (which looks exactly like an underline only
    I can control it better). This resulted in a MUCH nicer looking underline!
    I used this link from Stackoverflow for this:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9586596/control-underline-position-on-text-decoration-underline

/*
    This class is a fix for a bug I noticed on certain screen resolutions.
    When the width was between ~768px and ~991px (small devices) I noticed that
    the 2x2 rows were not looking right - the first row of 2 squares looked fine
    but the the next row was all messed up, one square was higher than the other.

    It turns out if 2 or 3 squares share the same height but one square doesn't,
    then the alignment is thrown off on the grid.

    This small padding increase fixes the issue by making all 4 squares the same
    height.
